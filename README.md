# unity2D-shootEmUp
A retro shootEmUp game genre with a theme about mental health struggle. You are living in a white dimension that represents your own mental state. The white dimension is your own numbness to the world, and the enemies are your dark thoughts that haunt you. You can either choose to not do anything in the white space, and be detached to all your enemy by not fighting them. Or you can start killing the enemies and gain the color back to the white space. However, by killing one enemy, you have no other option but to keep fighting.
